Options include:\n   *   **Eye drops:**  Autologous serum eye drops (e.g., hyaluronic acid) can help lubricate the eye and reduce tear production.\n   *   **Oral medications:**  Beta-blockers (e.g., timolol) can reduce eye pressure.\n   *   **Laser treatments:**  Laser procedures can be used to reduce fluid buildup in the eye.\n\n","\n   *   **Comprehensive Eye Exam:** A thorough eye exam is crucial to assess the eye's health, including visual acuity, pupil size, and optic nerve examination.\n   *   **Tonometry:** Measures intraocular pressure to assess for glaucoma.\n   *   **Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT):**  Provides detailed cross-sectional images of the retina to detect early signs of glaucoma.\n\n"
