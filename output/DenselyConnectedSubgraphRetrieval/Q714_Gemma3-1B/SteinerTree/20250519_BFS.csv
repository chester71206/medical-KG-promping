3101,"Doctor, I have been experiencing impotence, heartburn, blood in stool, and leg swelling. What could be the reason for these symptoms?","Since the provided table is insufficient to diagnose all the patient's symptoms and the instructions state to use medical knowledge if a reference table is unavailable, I will answer based on my knowledge.

1.  **Most Likely Disease:**

    Given the combination of impotence, heartburn, blood in stool, and leg swelling, a definitive diagnosis is difficult without further information. However, considering these symptoms together, a possibility could be **Advanced Heart Failure with complications.** Heart failure can lead to leg swelling (edema) due to fluid retention. Impotence can be a side effect of medications used to treat heart failure or due to decreased blood flow. Heartburn could be due to increased abdominal pressure from fluid retention or from medications. Blood in the stool is less directly related, but it could be a sign of medication side effects (e.g., from blood thinners, NSAIDs). Given the severity of symptoms, it may be indicative of an advanced condition requiring diagnosis.
