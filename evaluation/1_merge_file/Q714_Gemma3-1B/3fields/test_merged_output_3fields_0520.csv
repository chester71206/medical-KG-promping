Different MRI sequences (e.g., diffusion-weighted imaging) can help differentiate between benign and malignant tumors.\n    *   **CT Scan (Computed Tomography):** Can be used to assess the extent of tumors and rule out other conditions.\n*   **Biopsy:** A small tissue sample (biopsy) is taken from the affected nerves to examine under a microscope. This is often necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the specific subtype of neurofibromatosis.\n*   **Blood Tests:**\n    *   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** To assess overall health.\n    *   **Liver Function Tests (LFTs):** To evaluate liver function, as neurofibromatosis can sometimes affect the liver.\n    *   **Thyroid Function Tests:**  Neurofibromatosis can sometimes be associated with thyroid abnormalities.\n*   **Electrodiagnostic Studies (EMG/NCS):** These tests assess the function of nerves and muscles, which can help identify nerve damage associated with neurofibromatosis.\n\n**Disclaimer:** *I am an AI Chatbot and not a medical professional.

Different types of biopsies may be taken depending on the suspected type of dysplasia.\n*   **KOH Prep:** A KOH (crystal violet) preparation can be taken to examine the surface of the vulva for signs of infection or inflammation, which can sometimes be associated with dysplasia.\n*   **Blood Tests:** Complete blood count (CBC) and hormone levels (e.g., estrogen, progesterone) may be ordered to rule out other conditions and assess hormone levels that could be related to dysplasia.\n*   **Imaging (MRI or Ultrasound):** In some cases, an MRI or ultrasound of the pelvis may be used to assess the extent of the dysplasia and rule out other potential problems.\n\n**Disclaimer:** *I am an AI Chatbot and not a medical professional.
