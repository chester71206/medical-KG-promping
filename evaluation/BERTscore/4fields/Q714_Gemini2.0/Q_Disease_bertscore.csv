What tests do I need?","You will need radiographic imaging of your shoulder, including a plain x-ray to see the extent of the injury. We may also need to suture the wound, perform a complete blood count, and provide intravenous fluid replacement. Additionally, we will need to manage wound care and perform kidney function tests to monitor renal function.","\n\nBased on the symptom of a non-healing open wound on the shoulder, and considering the provided knowledge graph focusing on 'Open_wound_of_the_hip', there's a potential, albeit indirect, connection to conditions causing referred shoulder pain. Given the information, *without further information about the wound itself (infection, depth, etc.)*, it's difficult to pinpoint a single diagnosis.
