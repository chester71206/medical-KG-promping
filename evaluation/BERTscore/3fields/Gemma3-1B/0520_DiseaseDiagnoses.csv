    The patient reports both ""Leg pain"" and ""Back pain,"" which are key symptoms listed for Spondylitis in the provided table. While other conditions share some symptoms, Spondylitis is the only one that directly lists both of these prominent complaints. The weakness and difficulty in moving could also be related to Spondylitis and the resulting inflammation and pain.","\n   Leg pain, leg cramps, weakness, and difficulty in moving are highly suggestive of **Peripheral Neuropathy**, a condition affecting the nerves in the legs and feet. This can cause muscle weakness, pain, and cramping due to nerve damage. It can also be associated with other conditions like diabetes, vascular disease, and autoimmune disorders.\n\n","Thrombophlebitis. The combination of leg pain, leg cramps, weakness, and severe back pain strongly suggests a potential issue with a blood vessel, specifically a thrombophlebitis. Thrombophlebitis is a condition where a blood clot forms in a vein, causing inflammation, pain, and potentially leading to tissue damage.\n\n","Thrombophlebitis (Deep Vein Thrombosis) – The patient’s leg pain, leg cramps, weakness, and difficulty in moving, coupled with severe back pain, strongly suggest a possible blood clot in a deep vein. Thrombophlebitis is a condition where a blood clot forms in a deep vein, often in the leg. It can cause pain, swelling, and potentially lead to serious complications.\n\n","\n   Muscle strain/spasm, particularly in the back and leg, is the most likely diagnosis given the combination of leg pain, leg cramps, weakness, and difficulty moving. These symptoms could be related to muscle imbalances, nerve compression, or a musculoskeletal issue.\n\n","\n   Leg pain, leg cramps, weakness, and difficulty in moving are highly suggestive of **Peripheral Neuropathy**, a condition affecting the nerves in the legs and feet.

Peripheral neuropathy is damage to the peripheral nerves, leading to various symptoms. The back pain is a significant contributing factor and needs to be considered.

5442,"Infectious gastroenteritis. This is because it presents with fluid retention and can cause systemic symptoms that might manifest as spots/clouds in vision due to dehydration or electrolyte imbalances, even though vision changes are not directly listed.
