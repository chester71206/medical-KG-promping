A laryngoscopist (a doctor specializing in laryngeal examination) uses a small camera to visualize the larynx and throat. This allows them to directly assess the size and structure of the vocal cords, identify any swelling, and look for any abnormalities.\n*   **Imaging (X-rays or CT Scan):**  These scans can help rule out other potential causes of the lump, such as tumors or structural abnormalities.  They are less commonly needed initially but may be considered if the laryngoscopy is inconclusive or if there’s a concern for a more serious condition.\n*   **Allergy Testing:** If allergies are suspected, allergy testing (skin prick tests or blood tests) can help identify specific allergens that might be contributing to the problem.\n*   **Blood Tests:**  A complete blood count (CBC) can check for signs of infection or anemia, which could be related to the condition.  Other tests might be ordered depending on the patient’s history and symptoms.\n\n**Disclaimer:** *I am an AI Chatbot and not a medical professional.
